12-26-17: We left a little after 2am to drive to Salt Lake for my flight to LA. There was basically no one on the roads for most of at the drive, though it got really foggy in Salt Lake which was odd. I had to slow down to close to 30mph at points on the freeway because of the fog.
I had a short flight to LA then Cheryl picked me up at the airport. It was great to see her again after quite a few months.
We drove to her place, stopping at a grocery store along the way, and hung out for a little while, cuddling on the couch and watching Whose Line. We then drove to Pasadena to help work on the Cal Poly Rose Parade float since Brian could get us in to it. We worked on adding crushed rice to a white ribbon throughout much of the float, so we were actually on top of the float while working. It was surprisingly fun and took a bit of technique to do it effectively. Cheryl and I worked on the same thing independently but near each other. Brian was working on the scaffolding above. 
The float was airplane themed and had multiple animals flying different airplanes. It was pretty cool and quite large. They were working in a large building in a field surrounding the Rose Bowl, which is apparently where all the floats are decorated. It was really cool to see the process and be a part of it, and to be able to decorate a part of the float that is actually visible as well. 
We stayed for over three hours, then headed out. We drove along the Rose Parade route. It starts right at the televised part, with a long staging area beforehand. Then is the sharp turn and basically a long straight route before a couple turns right at the end, with the bridge at the very end. There were grandstands set up along the route at every point possible, and quite large ones as well. Apparently they’re all paid seating. There’s also an orange line that goes down the center of the street that the floats are all supposed to follow down the route.
We drove back and pretty quickly went to Cheesecake Factory. We went to the one on Redondo Beach which was a nice one on the waterfront. It was a really enjoyable meal, as Cheesecake Factory with Cheryl always is. It was a nice atmosphere and a lot of fun throughout. We both got milkshakes and cheesecake to take home.
We then went back and watched some more Whose Line before going to bed. It’s always a fantastic feeling climbing into bed with Cheryl, and even though we don’t do anything other than cuddle it is still so nice to lay there with her.
