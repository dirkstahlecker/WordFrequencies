10-22-17: I had an interesting dream about Christina Mottishaw last night. I don’t know why her in particular came up in it, but the dream was very explicit that it was her and that were were real intimate things happening between us, which was interesting.
I went this morning to go skate shopping with Colin and several frosh. Everyone was able to find skates which was great, and several others found floor skates that fit them.
I wandered around the floor to see who was there and talked with Sarah Flanagan for a few minutes, and she promised to play one game of hockey this year.
I practiced some at Kansas for the K&N race, then watched the NASCAR race from Kansas for the first stage.
I then went with Predrag to hockey, stopping at Play It Again Sports on the way to pick up the remainder of the skates that we left to get sharpened. It was the D/D+ clinic for two hours this afternoon which had a really good turnout, enough that we had to start turning people away because there weren’t enough pads to go around.
I had planned to work with the goalies, but no goalies showed up so I sort of bounced between the two sides helping out where I could. I suited up as goalie for the last bit of the D+ clinic where they were doing 3 on 2 drills.
I the reffed a D game between Navy and AeroAstro. Gabby is captain of the Navy team and it was nice to see her again.
Then was open ice for a scrimmage, and it ended up being me, Predrag, Gabby, Lily, Matt and Alex from the summer skate, and Conner and Hugh who I didn’t know before as the people that showed up, along with one goalie. We played 3 on 3 half ice and it was a really useful and a lot of fun. I talked with Gabby for a little while on the bench and she said it was the most fun she’s had playing hockey in a while. It was really nice to see her again and get to talk with her for a decent while.
Then was a D league game between Random and Next, and Predrag and I played for Random while Gabby played for Next. Whenever we were fighting each other for the puck we played each other quite hard and it’s fun to go at it along the boards with her.
