1-02-17: Dirk played the puck as goalie quite a bit, including to wave off several icings, worrying everyone on the bench but making it work in each situation. The quote of the night was from the referee Joe who asked Dirk "Why is it you hate icings?". 
Mikayla got her first of the season on another assist from Colin to extend the lead to 2-0. AeroAstro had some good rushes and were able to score on a breakaway and on an unfortunate bounce off of Dirk's stick. The game ended in a 2-2 tie. 
Game 2 of the D league double header saw Conner 5 play Navy ROTC. Colin took over for Dirk in net, and the rest of the lineup was the same except for Lisa and Savannah replacing Daniel. Andrea moved back to play defense for this game.
