9-12-10: After writing last night I texted Stephen and Pelletti for another hour. Pelletti said that he knows I like Caitlin and asked me if I was okay with him and Caitlin. I said that it was probably a good thing for everyone. He also said that everything actually started last night; they were just friends before that. As Stephen put it, "If nothing else, you can see what can be done with some guts."
I went to Stephen's house along with Pelletti to program and play Starcraft this evenings. It was fun, nothing really notable happened. I'm really not sure what I think about the whole Caitlin / Pelletti situation. I wonder if Caitlin even has the same perception of their relationship as Pelletti does. Hopefully some questions will be answered soon.
