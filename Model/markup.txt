9-12-10: After writing last night I texted [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] and [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] for another hour. [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] said that he knows I like [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] and asked me if I was okay with him and [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!]. I said that it was probably a good thing for everyone. He also said that everything actually started last night; they were just friends before that. As [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] put it, "If nothing else, you can see what can be done with some guts."
 I went to [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!]’s house along with [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] to program and play Starcraft this evenings. It was fun, nothing really notable happened. I'm really not sure what I think about the whole [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] / [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] situation. I wonder if [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] even has the same perception of their relationship as [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] does. Hopefully some questions will be answered soon.
 
 9-13-10: Every monday is PLC now, which is awesome. I chatted with [!!Bonnie|Bonnie_Sistrunk!!] a little bit, and she said that [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] doesn't like [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!]. That's good, but annoying at the same time. It makes me think that she's leading him on by holding his hand, which means that she could have been doing the same to me, which would really make me mad. But I need more information before I act on anything I've heard about this. 
 I wrote a song about how I might feel about [!!Lindsay|Lindsay_Horst!!] if things go perfectly. It turned out good; it was a lot less abstract than my others since I based it off a concrete situation and it has a different feel to it as well. I also posted my RYLA song on Facebook. [!!Sierra|Sierra_Miller!!], [!!Austin|Austin_???!!], and [!!Chris|Chris_Fries!!] have all said it's amazing, which is really neat. 
 
 Again, I may just be seeing things because I'm looking for them, but I feel obligated to write everything down nonetheless. I don't think [!!Lindsay|Lindsay_Horst!!] laughed at all today, and this was the first day since the first day of school that I haven't sat directly adjacent to her. I'm really hoping something positive will happen during this entire situation, but I'm really fluctuating as to whether it's something I even want to pursue. There are just so many barriers, both concrete and in my own mind. I really don't know right now. 
 On a positive note, [!!Andie|Andie_Staples!!] always smiles and waves when we pass each other in the halls, which means that she really does like me as a good friend. After not talking to her for about three quarters of a year, that's awesome. I really don't know how we actually became friends; I think it was just the fact that we'd smile and say hi to each other as we walked into class. I at least should start talking to the girls I might potentially like, even just hi sometimes. [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!] has been doing that lately, whenever she sees me in the halls or walks into debate she'll greet me. It's rather sudden, and even though I'm not interested in her, the fact that she's paying attention to me makes me a lot more interested than I would have been. Maybe doing the same to some other girls will have the same effect...
 I went to The Sorcerer's Apprentice with [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] and [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!] tonight. It was a good movie. The main character was really smart and a little weird, and didn't entirely fit in with everyone, kind of like me. But he was able to pretty easily pick up the girl, and I'm really hoping the same sort of story happens for me.
 
 9-15-10: I wore my orange plaid shorts with Ben's Transformers belt buckle. A bunch of people commented on it, and [!!Spencer|Spencer_Ruchti!!] loved it. As is usually normal, I spent lunch with [!!Hammer|Arthur_Hammer!!], [!!Donald|Donald_Young!!], Nate, and [!!Adam|Adam_Cummings!!]. I also found out that Ms. Margulieux is going to be the robotics coach from Century, which is going to be good. Lately I've been noticing that every time I see [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!] she'll greet me and talk to me for a minute. I'm trying to figure out why that is. Maybe she thinks I like her and is consequently being really nice to be, kind of like what happened with [!!Claire|Claire_Johns!!]. (We both thought that the other liked us, so we were each extra nice to each other, which only reinforced the assumption and made it difficult to finally sort it out). I'm wondering if this is what is happening with [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!]. I can't think of anything I did to make her think that I like her, although there are some times where she may have thought I was staring at her even though I truly wasn't. Also, she was one of the only other kids in debate at the back to school night tonight. She sat near me and talked to me a couple times. But she's not my type and I'm not going to have another [!!Claire|Claire_Johns!!] situation. The only girl I really might like that is my type might be [!!Lindsay|Lindsay_Horst!!]. 
 
 9-16-10: Once again [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!] seems to really be focused on me a lot of the time. She always calls my name when she sees me in the halls, even if its from the other side.  I really want to know what she truly thinks of me. I have trouble believing that she really likes me enough to warrant all of those behaviors. I always default to the explanation that she's either trying to make fun of me or that she's trying to gain something from me. It's getting to the point where I'm getting uncomfortable with it. I don't know the proper reaction because I don't know what her motives and general mindset even are. I don't want to be rude to her by ignoring her or distancing myself, but I definitely don't want anyone interpreting that I like her, and I suspect there's more than meets the eye with all of this. I was partnered with [!!Felisha|Felisha_Correll!!] for Public Forum in class. She's cool, but not the kind of person I'd really like to hang out with necessarily. Also, I realized that paranoid is a really good word to describe me. I automatically think that whenever a girl likes me that there's some ulterior motive. I am so paranoid about what the things I say will cause other people to do or think that I'm afraid to talk about certain things to certain people. I always overanalyze and overthink things where I should just do what I feel is best and not worry so much about it. I realize it, but I can't do anything about it. It isn't helped by that fact that I feel inferior to most girls in the sense of actually being in a relationship. I don't see myself as worthy of any of the girls that I like, and it makes things really difficult. 
 I was talking with [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!], [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!], and [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] on Stephen's chat program for a little while tonight. [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] mentioned that him and [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] are going on a "love hike" on Saturday morning. Even though I'm mostly over [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!], I still would go out with her if she was willing, without any hesitation. I'm not mad about her situation with [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!], but it just kind of frustrates me. That "love hike" is something I wanted for over a year. I tried and tried to work towards it, and nothing ever happened, whether it be due to me or her. And he's able to just come right in out of the blue and pick her up and do what I've tried forever to accomplish. I'm fine with the situation usually, but whenever he mentions it I always get a little frustrated with her and with myself. But if I see them holding hands or anything like that, I know I'll react a lot more severely. I think it all has to do with that fact that [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] is not a very affectionate person at all, at least to boys. I have never even hugged her. I always attributed it to the fact that she was just a shy person; which is very true. But to sees her holding hands with [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] makes me immediately cast doubts as to what she really saw in me during the summer camp and all of last summer. Was she mildly interested in me, but not nearly as much as [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] now? She never actually did tell me she liked me, and I never actually told her I liked her. It's obvious that I liked her, and I though it was obvious that she liked me during that time period, but I guess I don't know for certain.
 
 9-17-10: I saw [!!Andie|Andie_Staples!!] driving to school while I was this morning. I didn't know she lived up here, but I guess she does. I really need to find a time to actually have a conversation with her; it's been since second tri of last year. She seems like a pretty awesome person. During debate [!!Felisha|Felisha_Correll!!] picked me as a pofo partner. My initial perceptions of her seem to not be entirely accurate. She's nice and works hard, but has the sort of attitude where everything annoys her and just isn't the type of person I especially want to really hang out with. 
 This afternoon I went disc golfing with [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!], [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!], [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!], and [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!]. I got +7. Afterwards, I went to Stephen's house and played cards and scrabble with [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!], [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!], [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!], [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!], and Peyton. I won scrabble, and Peyton won most of the games of mao. She's one of the people that has a very powerful personality, and she's fun to be around because of it. However, she's not the kind of person I should like, and I don't think I will like her, but it is possible. I think [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] still kind of likes her even though he's [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!]’s boyfriend now. The girls needed to go to Fred Meyer, so we went there for about half an hour. It was kind of awkward walking with them through the store at 9:30 at night, especially since [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] wandered off by himself most of the time, leaving me and [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] with [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!] and [!!Peyton|Peyton_Kiggins!!]. I get the feeling that [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!], while I'm sure she doesn't like me, really respects me and enjoys being around me. Maybe more so than any other girl I know, aside from maybe [!!Bonnie|Bonnie_Sistrunk!!]. That's pretty cool; she goes to Century and isn't leaving soon, so I'll be able to hang out with her for a while longer. I highly doubt it, but the slight possibility exists that I'll even start to like her after [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] leaves. I doubt it though. 
 
 9-19-10: Yesterday morning I went on a Kinport hike with [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!], [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!], and [!!Dave|David_Angle!!]. It was a fast, hard hike but it was fun. The most interesting thing I learned is that [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] said that [!!Peyton|Peyton_Kiggins!!] said that all of [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!]’s friends are cute, and she would date them if they dressed like [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!]. She must be talking about me, [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!], and [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!]. That really shows what she's looking for in guys, and it's not their true personality and character. I don't like that. 
 Yesterday evening we went to Rocky Mountain Raceways for the last race of the year. The midgets, super stocks, modifiers, figure 8 cars, and figure 8 trains ran. One of the midgets got forced into the wall pretty hard making for a cool crash. The modifieds ran a 100 lap main event, which was awesome. The figure 8 cars weren't amazing, but the trains definitely were! There were once again 11, and the racing was amazing. The got spread all around the track, and were 2 and 3 wide the entire race. In one case, exiting turn 4, Six Feet Under started moving up the track. USA was on the outside, and had nowhere to go. They were forced straight into the wall in a massive hit. Everyone behind them started piling up, and there was a massive wreck that brought out the red flag. It was amazing.
 
 9-20-10: I chatted with [!!Andie|Andie_Staples!!] on Facebook for a while. She seemed to enjoy talking to me. She's doing debate again this year, and I think I convinced her to apply for Haywire. I think she'll do good on PR and Chairmans. I would really like to hang out with her sometime, outside of school. If I can figure out a way to do so that would be great.
 [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] called me to tell me several stories. He said that [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!] had called and wanted to come over to his house. He said that for whatever reason they had decided to take a nap under the covers of his bed. His step-dad, who didn't even know that they were dating, managed to walk into the room right then.
 The Big Bang Theory season 4 starts on Thursday. Everyone is going to come over here to watch it, which will be fun. 
 I landed my first ever front flip 360! I finally figured out how to tuck while flipping and rotating, and it was pretty easy, only taking 4 tries to land it!
 
 9-21-10: I talked to [!!Tim|Tim_Sudweeks!!], [!!Steven|Steven_Rogers!!], and [!!Nathan|Nathan_Tolman!!] about joining robotics, and I met [!!Andie|Andie_Staples!!] and gave her an application at lunch. Hopefully all of them apply and are accepted, I think they'll all make great team members. 
 I showed [!!Sierra|Sierra_Miller!!] my "logic and emotion" poem. She loved it, even saying "it's perfect." That is an awesome compliment. I know she really enjoys poetry, and I'm really glad she likes it so much. 
 I wrote another song about [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!] and how I keep getting the nagging feeling that all she's trying to do is lead me on. It turned out alright, but it pretty accurately represented my feelings.
 Debate today was by far the most interesting class of the year so far. I'm partnered with [!!Felisha|Felisha_Correll!!] for in class Public Forum, so I'm required to sit by her whenever we're in the lab, which I don't mind. She's interesting to talk to, but not someone I especially want to hang out with. [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!] and Madison came and sat next to me, leaving me between [!!Felisha|Felisha_Correll!!] and [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!]. [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!] kept playing with my jumpdrive lanyard, my backpack, and my binder. She asked me if I had gone to any of the dances, and I said that I hadn't. Her and [!!Felisha|Felisha_Correll!!] immediately questioned why, and kept trying to convince me to ask someone, suggesting "cute" ways in which to do it and saying a couple times that they would help me with it. Both of them also mentioned how they like nerds far more than jocks, and I specifically remember [!!Felisha|Felisha_Correll!!] saying that she would go to a dance with me if I asked. They kept mentioning how I must have a lot of girls that like me, and they said several times how awesome I was. I think [!!Felisha|Felisha_Correll!!] was at least mostly sincere, but I'm still wondering about [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!]. She's one of the people that would say all that stuff yet not mean it I think. I am really happy that [!!Felisha|Felisha_Correll!!] said she'd go to a dance with me, I think she's serious. It honestly was fun sitting between them the whole time, there was some interesting conversation, and in truth I enjoy actually having girls interested in talking with me. It's always in the back of my head, however, whether or not [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!] is actually sincere in what she says. I want to think she is, but I'm wary of being lured into her trap without realizing the full extent of the situation. It also makes it somewhat awkward because I really don't want people thinking I like [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!], because I really don't, but she could easily give people that illusion, and I'm too nice to ignore her or tell her to stop.
 
 9-22-10: I am pretty sure I have convinced [!!Nathan|Nathan_1!!] to join robotics. He'll be almost as good as [!!Ben|Ben_Devaud!!] at PR I think. 
 I talked with [!!Hammer|Arthur_Hammer!!] and [!!Kort|Kort_Guillette!!] at lunch. [!!Kort|Kort_Guillette!!] wants me and [!!Hammer|Arthur_Hammer!!] to run for ASB co-president next year. I'm contemplating it, it might be fun and it'll be great on a resumee. 
 In debate Mr. Nelson paired me and [!!Felisha|Felisha_Correll!!] with [!!Madison|Madison_Mansfield!!] and [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!] for a practice debate. We destroyed them, but they, for novices and for spending as little time as they did on their case, did pretty well. I wonder why it's [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!] that always seems to be by me. I really wish it was [!!Lindsay|Lindsay_Horst!!]; the connection I felt with her at the beginning of the year has kind of faded. I want to talk to her, but I can't figure out what to say and I have to admit, I feel awkward since she's a freshman. I can't bring myself to flirt with her, or even do anything that might possibly be interpreted as flirting. So basically, I haven't talked to her or interacted with her for a while now. It's annoying, but I don't know what to do about it. 
 
 9-23-10: Nothing really exciting happened at school today. After school, however, I talked with Mrs. Margulieux for a little while and she said that Haywire received a grant to make a second team. It was later confirmed by Mr. Sullivan through [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!]. It will be interesting to see how that works out.
 The Big Bang Theory premiered tonight. Sheldon actually went on a date! [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!], [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!], and [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!] came over to watch it, [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] being late as usual. It was a pretty good episode, but very awkward throughout.
 
 9-24-10: In debate [!!Nikki|Nikki_Francisco!!] kept marveling at some of the computer stuff I was doing such as programming and networking. She asked for my phone number at one point; I avoided giving it to her, I think because I didn't want to be perceived as liking her. 
 At 5 [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!] and [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] came over and we played disc golf at Sister City. We played through 9 holes, and [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!] lost his favorite disc on hole 9. We searched for half an hour before giving up and coming back home. [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] and [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] came shortly after, and the five of us played a little poker, with [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!] winning by a large margin. [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] and [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!] then showed up, and we decided to watch Iron Man, since [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] and [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] had never seen it before. [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!] sat on the green chair, his usual place. [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] was upstairs taking a nap on the couch, so [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!] sat on the right side of the downstairs couch, [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] next to her, then [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] and [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!]. After getting the movie set up, I made them all move over and I sat down next to [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!]. Since we had 5 people on a 3 person couch, it was pretty crowded, with no room between everyone. A little while in, I placed my hand on my right leg after I positioned my shoulder behind [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!]’s. Shortly after I noticed she had her left hand on her left leg, decently close to mine. I kept inching my hand closer, to see how she'd react. I think she even moved her hand closer to mine. I eventually let my finger touch her hand. She didn't react at all, and I just left my hand touching hers for a little while. It then came to the part in the movie where the girl has to reach her hand inside of Tony Stark's chest to replace the electromagnet. [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] was kind of freaking out that she didn't want to see her do that, so I slightly grabbed her hand. She took my hand, we interlaced fingers, and she squeezed my hand through that part of the movie. We held hands until she had to leave about 20 minutes later. That was honestly the first time I've ever held hands with a girl. It really was amazing, to find someone that I enjoy being around that is willing to show affection to me. I really enjoyed holding hands with her, and I almost see her differently now, as someone that definitely has a lot of potential. Hopefully good things will come out of it. I can't wait for next time!
 
 9-25-10: We went to Atomic City for the first time this year to see the last race of the year. They had a new class, the Atomic Bombers. They were really cool, almost like junkyard dogs, able to cut the track and spin out others legally. There were 10 modifieds, 4 of which were running at the end of the A main! There were a bunch of crashes and spins, and the ending was epic. The number 20 was in second, and going into turn 1 on the final lap, he dove into the corner and was able to get around the leader, number 17, giving him a bump in the process. However, 17 recovered quickly and drove really deep into turn 3, deliberately slamming the rear quarter panel of number 20. He spun out, but in the process, the third place car was able to get around both of them and take the win in a drag race to the finish! It was really exciting. The Atomic Bomber main was great as well. They were basically allowed to do whatever they wanted, and the last car running was the winner. There were cars taking out the signs in the infield, running on the go kart track, spinning out others, even crashing them into walls. It was really cool.
 
 9-26-10: [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] decided that we should have a Lord of the Rings marathon. [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!], [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!], [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!], and his friend Zach went over to [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!]’s mom's house to watch it. [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] came late, so I went and picked up [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!]. When we came to the door, [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!]’s mom mentioned something about the fact that it was strange to see me and [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!] come to the door, since she thought I didn't have a girlfriend. [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!] said "that might be about to change" and then said "don't think I wasn't watching." I figured everyone else probably saw us holding hands on Friday night, but I don't really care, I like and trust everyone there. We watched the first movie, and I texted [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] most of the time. I can tell she likes talking to me, and wants the conversation to continue. After the movie, we decided we couldn't watch another one and played cards for the last hour. 
 I wrote a song about [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] and how we held hands on Friday night. It turned out really good and really represents everything accurately I think. 
 
 9-27-10: The first AP US History II test is tomorrow. I really have no idea if I'm prepared or what I should even know. It'll be interesting to see how it goes. 
 I talked with [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] for a few minutes at lunch, and i've been texting her off and on all of yesterday and today. 
 Tonight was the NHS induction ceremony for the new sophomores. Everyone was required to go, but it was cool to show off my cookie monster tie and Transformers belt buckle. I was sitting by [!!Hammer|Arthur_Hammer!!] and [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] came and sat next to me. I've only rarely had girls do that. I was able to talk to her for a little while afterwards as well, and it was not nearly as awkward as most conversations are with girls I like. She really does seem to enjoy talking to me and texting me, more so than any other girl I can remember. It's just a great situation. 
 
 9-28-10: [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] texted me good morning this morning. [!!Bonnie|Bonnie_Sistrunk!!] is the only other girl I've ever had do that. When I got to school, early around 8:10ish, I saw her walking in the hall. I went over to her, she left her friends, and we walked around and talked until the bell rang. The conversation wasn't awkward, it wasn't incredibly easy to continue, but it's so much easier than with just about any other girl. It was nice to be able to talk to her in person, although its still fun to text her, which we're doing all the time. I'm considering asking her to the Homecoming dance. I just need to decide whether it's something I'm even interested in going to. I'm sure she would say yes, I really do think she likes me. Although I do want to talk to her sometime, and just make sure we're on the same page. I don't want there to be any misperceptions or misunderstandings to happen in the future. 
 After school, [!!Andie|Andie_Staples!!] started talking to me on Facebook. We had a good conversation, and she's someone I really enjoy talking to. I know a few weeks ago her status was changed to "single," and there were times when it sure seemed like she was flirting with me. I try to be nice, energetic, and happy when I'm talking to her, but I hope my words aren't coming across as flirting. While I really enjoy talking to her, she's not someone I really see myself with. Besides, I already have [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!].
 During the conversation [!!Andie|Andie_Staples!!] came right out and asked me about my religious and political beliefs, a boldness I respect. I agree with a lot of what she said, she's basically mirroring my realist side with a lot of her philosophies. She also came right out and asked for my phone number. I really admire the boldness of those statements. I really think I need to start thinking less about how my actions appear to others. I don't care a ton as it is, but I care enough to annoy myself sometimes. 
 
 9-29-10: We used these cool answering devices in history that, as you press the letter of the answer for a question, it will show on the projector the percentage of the class that answered each response. It's a neat system. 
 I talked with [!!Hammer|Arthur_Hammer!!], [!!Donald|Donald_Young!!], and Jacob after school for a while. We're contemplating doing an "anti-homecoming" instead of actually going to the homecoming dance. I do want to do something with [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!], I'm just not quite sure as to what. We are, however, going to be going disc golfing sometime soon. I bought a new Valkyrie driver, and I really want to try it out. Also, I really want to spend some more time with her outside of school. We've seen each other only in school since we held hands. 
 I'm really looking forward to Saturday. We're having a barbecue for a bunch of people, and then we're going to go to Kory's house to watch Iron Man 2 in blue-ray. It is going to be really cool, and hopefully really fitting. [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] and I first held hands during Iron Man 1, so hopefully we can do the same through Iron Man 2, only this time for more than 15 minutes!
 
 9-30-10: I talked with [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] for about 15 minutes before school today. She's perfectly willing to aimlessly wander the school talking to me, which is awesome. There are few people at century that I can just walk around and talk to and not feel awkward at any point. She's one of them, which is great. 
 We had the first test in Physics. It started out really hard, but got easy at the end. It is a difficult subject, but it's definitely fun. 
 I was partnered with [!!Gavin|Gavin_???!!] for LD practice today. I think he's going to be a good debater, he did really well when it came to thinking of values, criteria, and contentions. 
 The Big Bang Theory episode was awesome. Sheldon decided that he needs to stay in his room and make a "virtual presence" robot to go out into the world. It was really funny. 
 [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] and I are hopefully going disc golfing with [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!], [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!], and [!!Cait|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] tomorrow. It should be a fun time.
 As I've been thinking about everything happening with [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!], I'm not entirely sure what to think. I really want to make sure that this isn't another of my "she likes me so I'm automatically going to like her a lot more than I normally would have" deals. I hope it isn't. I really want this to work out. I know that I have fun with her, when she's hanging out with everyone, I always have fun talking to her and being around her. I'm not entirely sure right now if she's someone I really want to pursue all that far in a relationship. But I don't know that she's not. It's really late right now, so and it's one of those times that I have fairly large differences in thinking between normal times, but I just want to get everything written down. When I'm talking to her alone, she obviously seems interested in talking to me, and makes conversation, but it isn't quite the conversation that I imagine with my girlfriend. And I still don't know entirely where our relationship stands. I don't consider her a girlfriend yet, I think its more like we are more than friends, but not quite to the boyfriend/girlfriend stage yet. However, it's possible in the near future. I want to know where she stands. Is she calling me her boyfriend? I would doubt it, but I'll need to find out exactly what's going on soon. Hopefully I can have a chance to talk with her disc golfing tomorrow, and hopefully on Saturday night we can hold hands again during the movie. It's even Iron Man 2, so it would be really fitting. Maybe, since we'll probably be sitting outside on blankets, we can kind of cuddle while we watch. I don't know. It's one of those things I'll have to play it by ear and decide, based on context, people present, and current feelings, exactly how far I want to take it and how far she's willing to go. I don't feel like I'm taking a risk at all in holding her hand though. I fell confident that she'll be receptive to that during the movie, and its something I'm not hesitant to do. Any further than that maybe, but we'll see how it turns out.
 
 10-02-10: I talked with [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] for about 15 minutes before school. It's becoming a routine I think, one that we both enjoy. In Physics we worked on designing a lab to measure static friction. [!!Steven|Steven_Rogers!!] and I worked together, and it kind of reminded me of engineering a little bit. I really loved that class.
 During 3rd hour some people from Poky came and painted every single cars windows except for the teachers. We're playing them tonight, and I guess it was to intimidate us or something. It was pretty funny irony because apparently their quarterback got suspended because of his involvement with it.
 I went disc golfing at sister city after school with [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!], [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!], and [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!]. We played through 13 holes, stopping for almost half an hour at times to search for lost discs. We eventually found all of them though. [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] was able to come for the last 45 minutes. It was fun having her there; we have the kind of relationship where we kind of mock argue about everything, but we really like and respect each other. I really do think I have more fun individually with her than with any of the other girls I've liked before. I'm excited for the barbecue tomorrow night!
 
 10-03-10 AM: The barbecue was fun. [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!], [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!], [!!Junior|Junior_Visu!!], [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!], [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!], [!!DJ|DJ_Holt!!], [!!Spencer|Spencer_Ruchti!!], and [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] came, along with a bunch of adults. It was a lot of fun, we played ping pong, frisbee, and jumped on the trampoline. A fire was built eventually, so we sat around there for a little while. I sat on one of the white benches, [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] sat next to me, and [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!] came and sat next to her. Eventually, [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] came over, and made all of us move over so we could fit him on there as well, so we managed to fit four people on a white bench. At about 7:30, we went over to [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!] house to watch Iron Man 2 on the projector in his backyard. [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] had to leave unfortunately, but it was still fun to watch it. The movie was nowhere as good as the first one, I actually didn't enjoy it all that much, but it was fun to watch in the backyard with everyone. 
 
 10-03-10 PM: We went disc golfing with [!!Chuck|Chuck_Smith!!] today at Ross Park. I scored a +3 on the first round and a +1 on the second round! I was really close to getting a birdie three different times as well!
 I went disc golfing again at Ross Park at 5:30, this time with [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!], [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!], [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!], and [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!]. We played a round, I got +5, and then sat and talked for a while until [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!] and [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] had to go. [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!], [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!], and I talked for a while after, then she had to leave as well. [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] and I played another round, and then sat and talked for a while. I found out that he actually asked [!!Peyton|Peyton_Kiggins!!] out one time, but before they went on a date she changed her answer from "yes" to "no." I also found out that [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] has actually asked [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] out, and she said "yes." I don't know if I even want to formally ask [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] out. I like where our relationship is right now, but I definitely do need to talk to her sometime and make sure we're both on the same page. I would also like to go on a triple date sometime with [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] and [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!], I think that would be a lot of fun and wouldn't technically be a date either, but it essentially would be. 
 
 10-04-10: I went to play disc golf with [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!], [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!], and [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] after school today. It started raining, so we ended up sitting underneath the pavilion and talking for about an hour. It was fun, I enjoy talking to all of them. I am not able to make incredible conversation with [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!], but it isn't awkward and is better than I can do with most other girls. We then went to WICl's house and he explained the basis for the program. We're going to be able to get started on it, which is awesome. [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] and I played the upper 7 holes at Sister City afterwards. [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] said that she wants to learn about computers and programming and that kind of stuff so she can understand what we're talking about when we're discussing it. I'm going to start teaching her before school tomorrow.
 
 10-05-10: [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] came in before school and I started trying to teach her some basic networking. It turns out I know very little, not nearly enough to teach much. The other problem is that I feel uncomfortable teaching people that I don't feel superior to, and I don't feel superior to her. But I'm glad she's willing to come in and talk to me early in the morning. 
 I decided that I don't really want to go to the Homecoming dance. But I would love to do an anti-homecoming with [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] and [!!Cait|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] and [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] and I. It would be a ton of fun I think. 
 
 10-06-10: Today was well-dressed Wednesday. I wore fancy clothes and my cookie monster tie. A bunch of people stopped me to read the tie, and everyone loved it.  Afterwards, [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!], [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!], [!!Kory|Kory_Christensen!!], and [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!] came over and we watched Serenity. I was able to hold hands with [!!Kailyn|Kailyn_Cleveland!!] again, and that was great. I could tell she wanted me to hold her hand before I actually did. I considered putting my arm around her, but there didn't seem to be the right opportunity. I'll have to maybe consider it if we watch another movie soon. It is just so cool to have a girl that likes me enough to sit by me and hold hands.
