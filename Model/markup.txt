 9-12-10: After writing last night I texted [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!] and [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] for another hour. [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] said that he knows I like [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!] and asked me if I was okay with him and [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!!]. I said that it was probably a good thing for everyone. He also said that everything actually started last night; they were just friends before that. As [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!!] put it, "If nothing else, you can see what can be done with some guts."
 I went to Stephen's house along with [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] to program and play Starcraft this evenings. It was fun, nothing really notable happened. I'm really not sure what I think about the whole [!!Caitlin/Pelletti|Caitlin/Pelletti_@@@@!!] situation. I wonder if [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!!] even has the same perception of their relationship as [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!] does. Hopefully some questions will be answered soon.
 
 9-13-10: Every monday is PLC now, which is awesome. I chatted with [!!Bonnie|Bonnie_Sistrunk!!] a little bit, and she said that [!!Caitlin|Caitlin_Vitale-Sullivan!!!] doesn't like [!!Pelletti|Nathan_Pelletti!!]. That's good, but annoying at the same time. It makes me think that she's leading him on by holding his hand, which means that she could have been doing the same to me, which would really make me mad. But I need more information before I act on anything I've heard about this. 
 I wrote a song about how I might feel about [!!Lindsay|Lindsay_Horst!!] if things go perfectly. It turned out good; it was a lot less abstract than my others since I based it off a concrete situation and it has a different feel to it as well. I also posted my RYLA song on Facebook. [!!Sierra|Sierra_Miller!!], Austin, and [!!Chris|Chris_Fries!!] have all said it's amazing, which is really neat. 
 
 9-14-10: I think I'm going to join BPA, it seems really fun. And they offer a C++ programming competition, which is awesome! If there were a couple more skilled programmers in the school, we could compete in software engineering, but it's definitely more than I can do by myself. I debated [!!Scott|Scott_Ludwig!!] and [!!Ivy|Ivy_Christopherson!!] with [!!Kody|Kody_Harrison!!] as my partner. We used Michael and Tom's nationals case, and I think we won. [!!Scott|Scott_Ludwig!!] is really good though. 
 Again, I may just be seeing things because I'm looking for them, but I feel obligated to write everything down nonetheless. I don't think [!!Lindsay|Lindsay_Horst!!] laughed at all today, and this was the first day since the first day of school that I haven't sat directly adjacent to her. I'm really hoping something positive will happen during this entire situation, but I'm really fluctuating as to whether it's something I even want to pursue. There are just so many barriers, both concrete and in my own mind. I really don't know right now. 
 On a positive note, [!!Andie|Andie_Staples!!] always smiles and waves when we pass each other in the halls, which means that she really does like me as a good friend. After not talking to her for about three quarters of a year, that's awesome. I really don't know how we actually became friends; I think it was just the fact that we'd smile and say hi to each other as we walked into class. I at least should start talking to the girls I might potentially like, even just hi sometimes. [!!Nikki|Nikki_alskdjfalksd!!] has been doing that lately, whenever she sees me in the halls or walks into debate she'll greet me. It's rather sudden, and even though I'm not interested in her, the fact that she's paying attention to me makes me a lot more interested than I would have been. Maybe doing the same to some other girls will have the same effect...
 I went to The Sorcerer's Apprentice with [!!Stephen|Stephen_Cox!!!] and [!!Paige|Paige_Durney!!] tonight. It was a good movie. The main character was really smart and a little weird, and didn't entirely fit in with everyone, kind of like me. But he was able to pretty easily pick up the girl, and I'm really hoping the same sort of story happens for me.
